## Description
---
A database-structured back end populated with sample Products, Categories, and Product Tags.
    

    
## Installation
---
Clone the repository.  Create a .env file populated with your personal MySQL login information.  'npm install' to install dependencies.  Then open mysql shell and run the command 'SOURCE db/schema.mysql' to create database and tables.  From there, run 'npm run seed' from the command line to seed sample data into all categories.


    
## Usage
---
All interaction is done via Insomnia or Postman.  Since this is backend only, we must use one of these products to send requests to the server and ensure they complete.
